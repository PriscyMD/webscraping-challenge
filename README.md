# webscraping-challenge

## An overview of the project and its purpose
### You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage. As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

## Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
- Open the Jupyter Notebook in the starter code folder named part_1_mars_news.ipynb. You will work in this code as you follow the steps below to scrape the Mars News website.

### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
- Open the Jupyter Notebook in the starter code folder named part_2_mars_weather.ipynb. You will work in this code as you follow the steps below to scrape and analyze Mars weather data.
  
## At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
- At the beginning everything was fine since most of the 1st part came in the exercises of the class, from the second day of class there were similar codes, with similar exercises on the third day of class, when I did not know what to write or did not understand the code, I deepened with BlackBox.ai each part of the code.
